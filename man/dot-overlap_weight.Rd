\title{Compute follow-up overlap with an attained-age band}
\usage{
.overlap_weight(band_lower_age, band_upper_age, entry_age, exit_age)
}
\arguments{
\item{band_lower_age}{Numeric scalar or vector giving the lower
boundary of the attained-age band.}

\item{band_upper_age}{Numeric scalar or vector giving the upper
boundary of the attained-age band.}

\item{entry_age}{Numeric scalar or vector giving age at entry.}

\item{exit_age}{Numeric scalar or vector giving age at exit
(event or censoring).}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar or vector giving the overlap duration.
Returns 0 where the intervals do not intersect.
}
\description{
Computes the amount of follow-up time contributed within a single
attained-age band.
}
\details{
Specifically, this function returns the length of the intersection
between the subject's follow-up interval
\code{[entry_age, exit_age)} and the attained-age band
\code{[band_lower_age, band_upper_age)}.

All intervals are treated as left-closed, right-open.
}
\examples{
.overlap_weight(
  band_lower_age = 50,
  band_upper_age = 60,
  entry_age = 55,
  exit_age = 65
)
