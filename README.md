# HDccAnalysis

**HDccAnalysis** provides tools for high-dimensional case–cohort analysis in R.
It supports both typical and untypical case–cohort study designs and
implements commonly used weighting schemes, including those of Prentice,
Barlow, and Binder.

The package is designed to facilitate efficient and reproducible analysis of
high-dimensional survival data arising from case–cohort sampling frameworks.

## Installation
