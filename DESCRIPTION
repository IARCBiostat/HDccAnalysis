Description: Provides statistical methods for analysing case-cohort sampling
    design studies in high-dimensional settings. The package supports
    evaluation and performance assessment tools for both typical designs
    (all cases outside the subcohort included) and untypical designs (a subset
    of cases outside the subcohort included). It implements multiple
    weighting schemes, including Prentice, Barlow, and Binder weights, and is
    designed to facilitate reproducible and efficient workflows for
    epidemiological research.
